Rischan - Final Report for Ubiquitous Class

In Ubiquitous Class, My Professor want me to manage that class. Please see project in https://github.com/rischanlab/ubiquitousClass

In that project, I asked all of students to collect their personal data such as gait data when they run, stand, walk, etc, earshape, 
and etc. 

The aim of this class is to implement previouse works from our lab with different dataset. 

This project is my final report for this class.

The content of this project can be seen directly in this project and you can access the source code in directory source code. 

All of work in this project coded by using R language.
